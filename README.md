**Please do not make feature requests!  I'll just close the issue.
Please don't take it the wrong way---if you want something, I'm happy to
work with your efforts to patch the existing system.**

features, please contact me privately.**

## Synopsis

*slant* is a remote system monitor.  For the time being, it only works
with OpenBSD hosts.

The website has all the information you might need, and the manpages
document the system itself.

The GitHub site is for issues and pull requests: source code is
versioned in a private [BSD.lv](https://bsd.lv) repository.

If you'd like to help out, please e-mail the author.
